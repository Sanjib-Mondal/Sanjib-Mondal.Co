I have a broad range of interdisciplinary research interests including continuum and materials modelling, fracture and damage mechanics, computational mechanics, and mathematical modelling. My research provides new understanding in forecasting risk and damage in a range of applications transferable across different industry sectors including oil and gas, mining, construction, composites and manufacturing.
