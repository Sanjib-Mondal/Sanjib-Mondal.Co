I have a broad range of interdisciplinary research interests including continuum and materials modelling, fracture and damage mechanics, computational mechanics, and mathematical modelling. My research provides new understanding in forecasting risk and damage in a range of applications transferable across different industry sectors including oil and gas, mining, construction, composites and manufacturing.

# Current Projects
1. Machine Learning Algorithum for mining data analysis and predection model development.
2. Laboratory experiments and model development for measuring the shear strength of cleated coal.  
3. Damage analysis of anchored concrete.  
4. Development of armour protection.
