I recently finished my PhD degree from The University of Queensland, Australia with a broad range of interdisciplinary research interests including continuum and materials modelling, fracture and damage mechanics, computational mechanics, and mathematical modelling. My research provides new understanding in forecasting risk and damage in a range of applications transferable across different industry sectors including oil and gas, mining, construction, composites and manufacturing. I am an adaptable and transformational leader with an ability to work independently, collaboratively, creating effective presentations, and developing opportunities that further establish organizational goals.
