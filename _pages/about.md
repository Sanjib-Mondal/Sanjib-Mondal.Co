I am a recent PhD graduate from The University of Queensland, Australia with proven programming skills in Python, C++ and MatLab. My mathematical, statistical, analytical and computational knowledge can be applied to solve any problem requiring numerical and analytical expertise, data analysis and visualization. I have an excellent presentation, communication, motivational, interpersonal, project management and leadership skills which can be transferable in any working space. I am an adaptable and transformational leader with an ability to work independently, collaboratively, creating effective presentations, and developing opportunities that further establish organizational goals.
